# Project Proposal

**Book Choice and Justification:**

- 1984 by George Orwell  
- 1984 is a dystopian novel that follows the main character- Winston Smith, a man living under the oppressive rule of the Party, who is trying to rebel against the Party and its symbol Big Brother. The novel explores themes of surveillance, government control, propaganda, and individual freedom.   
- I chose this book because its themes such as political censorship and manipulation are still relevant ideas today. Whilst I don’t plan on damaging the reputation of any existing government, I can still use this project as a means of illustrating certain themes and aspects within the book

**User Experience Type:**

- The format of my project will be a website. This will enhance the story or themes of my book as it allows for an interactive user experience, without the need to install anything and in the simple click of a google search.

**Target Market:**

- My intended audience would primarily be whoever the book appeals to. Primarily, the target audience for this book would be those who are interested in dystopian literature.  
- My project will appeal to them as it will allow for a more 3D experience, with interactive elements and engagements.  
- My design choices will cater to this audience as it will include many visual elements as described in the novel, as well as colours, tone, etc. An example is the “Big Brother” image and the “newspeak” text.

**Software and Tools:**

- Figma: For UX Design. This is suitable for my project because it has a very intuitive UI which makes it easy to use, and further is a very popular tool for UX design because of how powerful and effective it is.  
- Canva/Adobe Illustrator: For creating custom graphics/images/elements. This is suitable for my project as I have a lot of experience in using them, and they are very intuitive yet effective to use.This is further added with the fact that the visual design course I did in year 9 centered around these 2 applications.

**Brainstorming:**
