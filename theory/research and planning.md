| **Adobe XD**    | - Adobe XD was built with collaboration in mind, offering co-editing, shared design systems, and live feedback features, making it suitable for team environments. <br> - It includes a large library of preset UI elements and assets, which can be very helpful for beginners who are still learning how to create effective components. <br> - The interface is clean and minimal, making it easier to focus on designing without distraction. <br> - It shares a similar layout and functionality with other Adobe apps like Photoshop and Illustrator, which helps users familiar with Adobeâ€™s ecosystem transition smoothly. <br> - Offers powerful prototyping and auto-animate features for simulating user flows and transitions with minimal effort. | - While collaboration is supported, it still trails behind Figma in terms of seamless real-time editing and browser-based convenience. <br> - Being a desktop application, it requires download and regular updates, which may slow down access and workflow compared to web-based tools. <br> - It may feel overwhelming for users unfamiliar with Adobe products, especially those new to digital design. | - Adobe XD is a strong choice for those already within the Adobe ecosystem and for more detailed prototyping needs. <br> - It supports collaborative work well but may not be the first choice for teams needing constant, synchronous updates in real time. <br> - The availability of preset assets is particularly valuable for new designers building their foundational skills. |
| **Figma**       | - Figma is fully cloud-based, allowing teams to collaborate in real time from anywhere without installations or version control issues. <br> - Its interface is intuitive for beginners, with drag-and-drop functionality, reusable components, and style systems that promote design consistency. <br> - Commenting and sharing features are robust, making feedback loops efficient and clear. <br> - It supports plugins and integrations that extend functionality, from accessibility checks to design token syncing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | - Large and complex files can slow down performance, especially on lower-end devices or slower connections. <br> - Offline capabilities are limited, making it less reliable without internet access. <br> - The reliance on browser sessions sometimes causes syncing or memory issues for extended usage.                                                                                                 | - Figma is ideal for modern, collaborative design teams needing flexibility and rapid iteration. <br> - Its plugin ecosystem and team-oriented features make it a leader in UI/UX workflows. <br> - Best suited to projects with multiple stakeholders and frequent revisions.                                                                                                       |
| **Canva**       | - Canva is extremely user-friendly, with a drag-and-drop interface that allows anyone to create polished visuals quickly. <br> - Offers a vast collection of templates, graphics, and fonts suited to social media, presentations, and light web mockups. <br> - No installation neededâ€”runs entirely in the browser and saves progress automatically. <br> - Ideal for non-designers or those working on lightweight visual projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | - Canva isnâ€™t designed for creating functional UI mockups or prototyping interactions. <br> - Users have limited control over spacing, grid systems, and precision layout adjustments. <br> - It lacks design system tools like components, auto layout, and responsive behavior.                                                                                                                           | - Canva is excellent for generating quick, professional-looking content <br> - Ideal for brainstorming or visualising concepts before moving into a dedicated design tool like Figma or XD. <br> - Its simplicity is both a strength and a limitation depending on the project's needs.                                                    |

**Evaluate Feedback:** 
Based on the user feedback collected through the Google Form, I learned that while my layout is generally intuitive and easy to navigate with an average ratings of 3.75, there is room for improvement in both aesthetic appeal and more efficient use of space. However, while aesthetics may have recieved a lower rating, this can be attributed to the fact that wireframes aren't made to demonstrate aesthetic appeal. However, I will still take this into account when considering the layout for my prototype.
