# Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The website must respond quickly to user actions, such as navigating between pages or selecting interactive elements. All transitions and load times should occur within 1–2 seconds to ensure a smooth and engaging experience. Optimised images, code minimisation, and browser caching will be used to improve speed and performance.
* **Useability:**  The design will prioritise user-friendliness by using a consistent layout, intuitive navigation, and readable fonts. Features like hover effects, large clickable areas, and keyboard accessibility will be implemented to make the experience easier for a wide range of users. Clear headings and feedback messages will guide users through interactions like quizzes or translating words.
* **Reliability:** The website will be tested across multiple devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to ensure it performs consistently. All links, buttons, and animations will be tested thoroughly to avoid broken features or errors. A backup of the project will be maintained to restore functionality quickly in case of technical issues.
* **Security:** Although the site will not collect personal data, basic precautions will be taken to prevent vulnerabilities such as spam through any feedback forms. If any form is included, it will avoid storing user data and will provide clear consent messaging. All external content (images, fonts, libraries) will come from trusted and secure sources.

# Social, Ethical and Legal Issues
* **Social Impact**: The experience is designed for audiences and fans of dystopian books or 1984. It will include design features like clear fonts and keyboard navigation and content will match the serious tone of the novel without overwhelming sensitive users. The project promotes reading and deeper understanding of George Orwell’s ideas through interactive storytelling.However,  some users may find themes like surveillance or psychological control distressing. These will be introduced with clear content warnings and handled respectfully.
* **Ethical Responsibilities:** No personal data will be collected within my prototype, eliminating risks related to privacy or data misuse. The book includes controversial themes like torture and authoritarianism. However, these will be suggested rather than shown in detail.
* **Legal Considerations**: Short quotes and references will be used under fair use for education, with credit given for any external assets. Original visuals and tools will be created to avoid copyright issues. If published, the project will follow platform rules and include a disclaimer stating it is for education and non-profit. All external media will be sourced legally or credited properly.
