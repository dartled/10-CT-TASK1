**Evaluation:** The user feedback I received gave me a good idea on what areas of my website that I needed to focus on and what parts of the project that I was already doing well within. The results of my google form found an average 3.38 stars within how intuitive the layout was, and an average 3.25 stars within how easy to navigate my layout appeared. However, the results of my interview feedback highlighted that the layout was very user-friendly, and intuitive.

I believe my visual design elements have not yet met user needs, as for this first prototype my intentions were only to establish the layout before I move on with aesthetics.However, from my perspective my accessibility features have effectively met user needs, as my design allows users to quickly shift from different part of the sites quickly.

The similarities between the google form and the interview were emphasised within the aesthetics of the prototype. The results of my google form found an average rating of 2.75 within how aesthetically pleasing the layout was, while my feedback from the interview suggested I needed to change the colour scheme and consistency. The difference between my google form and interview lied within how user-friendly my prototype was. My google form received lower reception then with my interview. 

Thus, at the moment, the most critical area for improvement is within the aesthetics of the prototype.

**Evaluation:** The user feedback I received was a good improvement to the last prototype, especially in the aesthetics department. This has a positive impact on my project, showing that my new prototype is more engaging and better on the eyes then the previous one. The results of my google form found an average 4.14 stars within all areas of my prototype. Moreover, the results of my interview highlighted that the layout now looked alot better than before, and highlights the 1984 colour palette quite well.

Despite this, a small concern lied within how much was going on. I was suggested to remove the binary code pattern within the design. As a result, for the next prototype I will be removing this, and enhancing visibility by adding more colour contrasts.

**Evaluation:** The user feedback I received was a nice improvement to the last prototype within all areas. The results of my google form found an average 4.3 stars on how intuitive the layout was, and an average 4.4 stars on how easy it looks to navigate. I believe that my design elements and accessibility features met user needs as I was able to balance looks with ease-to-use. In addition, the interview responses also showed better results compared to last prototype.
