# Final Evaluation

The final product largely meets its functional requirements by providing interactive experiences such as character profiles, a Newspeak translator, and quizzes, In addition, the user journeys work as intended. From a non-functional perspective, my design elements and accessibility features meet user needs as I was able to balance looks with ease-to-use. The product aligns well with the goals outlined in the design brief, which aimed to create an engaging website for audiences to explore George Orwell’s 1984. Further, it uses interactive elements to simplify complex themes like control, propaganda, and surveillance. 

The site thoughtfully handles the social and ethical complexities of 1984 by avoiding graphic content . It fairly represents the novel’s characters and themes without promoting any one ideology, and it respects the intellectual property of the original work by relying on educational fair use. No personal data is collected, however, if I was to build my prototype into a real website, the only data that will be collected is the responses on quizzes in order to generate responses. However, this would remain strictly anonymous.

Although how I effectively managed my time was slow at the start, once I managed to establish my wire frames it allowed me to set a clearer direction into where I was going and allowed me to reach my next milestones on time.

Furthermore, I effectively gathered and responded to user feedback. This is evident in my feedback ratings, as they progressively got better with each prototype. It influenced my design decisions as I became aware of which parts might be unneccesary, distracting, or if anything should be added. However, some aspects of my product that still require improvement could be the consistency of colours and design, as this can make it easier on the eyes. Another aspect could be my use of space, as in some pages there is alot of blank space, while in others, it feels a bit cramped. 

The final product effectively meets the goals of the design brief by offering interactive features that engage users with the themes of 1984. It satisfies both functional and non-functional requirements while handling social and ethical elements responsibly. Although some visual aspects like spacing and colour consistency could be improved, the positive feedback and clear progress show that the project successfully met its purpose.
